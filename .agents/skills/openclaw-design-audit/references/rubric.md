# Design Audit Rubric

## Mechanical Rules

| ID                    | Check                                                                |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `token/raw-color`     | New raw colors where a semantic token exists                         |
| `token/undefined`     | Custom properties used but not defined by package or consumer        |
| `token/legacy-alias`  | New code depends on a migration-only alias                           |
| `component/duplicate` | Raw control or primitive duplicates an established local primitive   |
| `component/state`     | Missing hover, focus, disabled, loading, invalid, or selected state  |
| `layout/overflow`     | Text or fixed-format UI clips or causes accidental horizontal scroll |
| `a11y/name`           | Interactive control lacks an accessible name                         |
| `a11y/focus`          | Keyboard focus is hidden, trapped, or incoherent                     |
| `theme/parity`        | Light or dark theme loses content, hierarchy, or contrast            |
| `asset/rights`        | New distributable asset has no recorded rights                       |

## Judgment Checks

| ID                         | Check                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hierarchy/primary-action` | Competing primary actions obscure the decision                          |
| `layout/card-overuse`      | Sections or cards are unnecessarily nested or floated                   |
| `typography/scale`         | Type scale does not match its container or task density                 |
| `brand/accent`             | Coral, sea glass, or status colors are used without their intended role |
| `marketing/subject`        | First viewport hides the actual product, place, person, or offer        |
| `copy/clarity`             | Interface text is vague, inflated, or does not name the action          |

## Severity

- `error`: broken interaction, accessibility barrier, illegible theme, accidental
  overflow, missing asset rights, or deterministic contract violation.
- `warning`: likely drift or inconsistency with meaningful user impact.
- `info`: improvement with limited current impact.

Do not mark aesthetic preference as a violation. A finding needs source or
rendered evidence and a documented rule.
